## Implementing CoreData

<p>Successfully adding email & pass to coredata
<p>Successfully loading all email & pass from coredata
  <p> To see all user's data uncomment the line AllUsers() to see all your users data.
    <p><b>Note: Remember to add some users before you uncomment AllUsers() else it will crash for sure.

## TODO:
<p>Check if email already present before adding to coredata.
<p>Encrypt & Save it using CryptoKit
<p>Decrypt & retrieve it using CryptoKit.

Thanks!
